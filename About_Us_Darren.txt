Darren, “The ‘old man’ of often too many words”.<br/>
Hi, I'm Darren Hardy and I am the CEO of Aleph-null Ltd.<br/>
I became interested in computer programming in 1981 after realising that the writing on the screen of a friend's TV was emanating from the large ‘calculator’ on the floor.<br/> 
The calculator was a Sinclair ZX81 personal computer.<br/> 
After many hours of manually typing code from a magazine onto the TV I was amazed when we discovered that the code could be transferred using an audio lead onto a tape recorder and later, with varying success replayed back into the TV. How clever!<br/> 
For the majority of my career I have been self employed.<br/> 
In 1985 when I was 18 I took over joint ownership of, and helped to run, our 'family run' pub (bar).<br/>
In 1991 we agreed that I could buy a £3000 Dell computer (a mighty sum in those days) to help with managing the business finances which wasn't easy because the business was significantly overdrawn.<br/>
The computer had the first Pentium 60 processor (upgrade from the 486 pc), 4 MB (not Gigabytes) of RAM and a 350 MB hard drive.<br/>
A friend asked me what i was going to use all of that storage for?<br/>
During the day I worked in the construction industry, worked sessions behind the bar in the evening and stayed up late learning finance, accounting and computing at night.<br/>
Within 2 years, I had taken control of the finances, stock control and pricing using Microsoft Excel and written tools to help with this using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications in those days).<br/>
Businesses would previously have no option but to trust their suppliers pricing and just pay invoices. Our suppliers were amazed that I was able to calculate accurately penny increases in product prices and be able to tell them which products had been increase contrary to our agreement.<br/>
The telesales staff would call management for help during our weekly order negotiations and declare in the office, "Computer man is on the phone".<br/>
The power of computing propelled the business into a comfortable financial position as Bill Gates predicted in his book "The Road Ahead".<br/>
In the mid 1990's we lost significantly investing in the Tech stock boom (don't remind me) and over 3 weeks were, as an anonymous forum poster predicted, "played like a piano".<br/>
At 19, I qualified with distinctions in City and Guilds Carpentry and Joinery, learned plastering, and started my own construction company "Adur Construction".<br/>
In 2006, Part 'P' was introduced in the Electrical industry and I gained the 2382 - 17th Edition Electrical Installation and 2391 - Electrical Testing and Inspection qualifications.<br/>
I started an Electrical Installation company "DHardyElectrical" and joined the NICEIC as an Approved Contractor which i ran until 2013.<br/>
This was a difficult time for my family. The 2008 Banking crisis took its toll and we were one of many families that lost their homes.<br/>
After a period of nine months without work I decided to take another direction in my career and applied to study Electronic and Computer Engineering at the University of Brighton.<br/>
In the foundation year, I achieved one of my bucket list dreams, programming an EPROM, which i thought was cutting edge technology.<br/>
A 1st Class Honours may have been possible if I had not become obsessed with programming microcontrollers in year 1 and FPGA's (very fast reconfigurable processors that 'parallel' process digital logic) in year 2.<br/>
I Graduated from the University of Brighton with 2:1 MEng Electronic and Computer Engineering in 2018 at the grand age of 51 (it’s never too late) not at all confident that I would be able to secure employment.<br/>
A technological button click can be life changing. I submitted 'available for work' on LinkedIn without realising this request would go out to the world and a good friend (who didn't often visit the site) saw this.<br/>
He had secured a position in a local start-up company and overheard the Boss mention that the company was looking for additional Engineers. I secured a job as a Senior Embedded Systems Engineer with the company after an interview, during which I realised that my Boss and I had lived only 200m apart for many years, shared a mutual interest in Technology and Computing from a very early age, and I was surprised that we had not 'crossed paths' proir to the inverview.<br/> 
Sammy joined the company two years later and we have worked closely together since then and will hopefully continue to do so.<br/>
